<h2>Why Arduino?</h2>
        
Arduino gives builders a gift—a way to bridge the gap between code and the physical world. At the heart of every Arduino board is a programmable microcontroller chip with names like ATMega2560 and ARM-Cortex-M. If you imagine a laptop, take away the screen and the keyboard, and shrink everything else down to a miniature scale, you won't be too far away from a microcontroller.

Microcontrollers come in a single integrated circuit.

Arduino helps out hobbyists by putting them on a larger board like this.

The Arduino board gives easy access to the tiny pins of the IC and makes it possible to plug in standard connectors for power and USB communications.

What makes the microcontroller so powerful isn't its computational capabilities (they are pretty pathetic compared to the processor in your phone). What makes it special is the large collection of input/output pins.

<ul>
<li>
Digital I/O pins which can pass high (3.3 or 5 Volts depending on the board) and low (0 Volt) signals to another circuit, as well as read high and low signals from them.
</li>
<li>
Analog input pins, which use an analog-to-digital converter to read the voltage from an outside source to a fine resolution.
</li>
<li>
Analog output (DAC) pins, which use a digital-to-analog converter to sustain a pin at any voltage from a near-continuous range.
</li>
<li>
PWM (Pulse-width modulated pins, which approximate an analog voltage by rapidly switching back and forth between high and low voltages. For example, to maintain an average voltage of 2.2 Volts, a PWM signal will switch between 0 and 3.3 Volts, spending two-thirds of its time at 3.3 V and one-third of its time at 0 V.
</li>
<li>
Specialized communication protocol pins, like UART, CAN, I2C, and SPI.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shields and Carriers</h3>
A microcontroller on its own is cool in concept, but isn't particularly useful. Arduino makes it easy to extend them by adding on other components. These extension boards can be stacked below (carriers) or above (shields) the Arduino boards on rows of carefully laid out pins. Shields seem to be much more common than carriers.


Shields give you a huge Swiss Army knife of tools

<ul>
<li>Ethernet</li>
<li>WiFi (although some boards come with this)</li>
<li>Extra memory</li>
<li>Relay switches</li>
<li>Motor controllers</li>
<li>Temperature other environmental sensors</li>
<li>Inertial measurement units</li>
<li>Microphone and some speech processing</li>
<li>Camera and some vision processing</li>
<li>LED and LCD displays</li>
</ul>

<h3>Models and form factors</h3>
There are a handful of different form factors with names like UNO, MKR, Portenta, Nano, and Giga. Here is a really helpful breakdown of the different boards and some of the shields and carriers that go with them. When in doubt, start with the latest UNO base and build from there. UNO is meant to be a somewhat universal starting point.

Most Arduino boards and shield are physically compatible, although this post on the Arduino forum strong encourages us to check the voltage (3.3 V vs 5 V) compatibility and the software library compatibility as well.

Because all Arduino designs are open, there are a large number of Arduino-compatible , Arduino-adjacent, and Arduino spinoff boards and shields. It can all get a little overwhelming. It's the downside of not having a single corporate overlord dictating a conveniently consumable lineup of marketing-approved SKUs. Read item descriptions and blog posts carefully, prepare for some thoughtful trial and error, and embrace the anarchy.

        Data Engineering for the Absolute Beginner

    There's a bewildering collection of jargon, but most of the concepts in data engineering are ideas that you're already familiar with.

The building blocks
These are the pieces of which all data engineering projects and systems are built.

Data
Data is really easy to define until you sit down to write a definition of it.

If you break it down finely enough, data is all made out of ones and zeros. But that’s not really helpful. That’s like saying that if you break down a wristwatch down finely enough, it's made out of a bunch of atoms. It's technically true, but the interesting part of a watch is the structure the atoms take when they’re put together.

Data is one and zeros put together in a way that means something. They might be a name, a phone number, an image of someone’s face, a recording of their voice. These are all different types of data, and what gives them meaning, what makes them worth storing and pushing from one computer to another, is that they represent something.

There are a few basic data types that come up all the time

data type	examples
integers	1, 2, 3, 0, -1, -2, -3, and so on
floating point numbers	anything with a decimal place
characters	a, b, c, A, B, C, #, @ for example
strings	more than one character, strung together in a row
boolean	can be just 'true' or 'false'

These go by different names in different computer languages, but are largely the same. The number of ones and zeros used to represent each type can differ by language, operating system, and processing hardware but it is well defined. This is important, because if you tell a data engineer that you want to store a billion credit card numbers, they will be able to work out how many integers that will require, how many ones and zeros they'll need to cover that, and tie it back to how many dollars it will cost you to store them per year.

These fundamental data types can be used to build more complex ones. Global position, given by latitude and longitude, is a pair of floating point numbers (floats), as in (56.431440, -6.341224). Names are a collection of strings for first, last, middle, honorific, suffix, etc., as in

Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso

Dates and times (often mushed together into a "datetime" type) can actually be represented by integers, floats, or strings, depending on what you are using them for.

Summary
Shoppi, a small company with a shopping list app, is building a list completion feature.

A large language model provides

Simple architecture
Versatility beyond training data
A recommender system provides

Item discovery
High relevance
A rule-based approach provides

Low computation cost
Low latency
Transparency (explainability and debuggability)
The Shoppi team opted for a rule-based solution as a first step, instead of an LLM or a recommender system, because it suits their limited resources and aligns with their product strategy. They plan to transition to a recommender system in 18 months, as the engineering team and user base grows and allows them to take advantage of their scale.

Scenario
Choosing whether to power an intelligent feature with a traditional recommender system, hard-coded rules, or an LLM is a game of give and take between several highly desirable charactertistics, including performance, maintainability, and cost. The right answer will be different in every situation.

In this particular example, Shoppi is a fictional startup that has built an app for writing and managing grocery shopping lists. Shoppi is bootstrapped. The company has 22 employees, and the app just passed 80,000 monthly subscribers at 3 USD per month.

Shoppi has 12 engineers, 7 frontend engineers covering iOS, Android, and web versions of the app, and 5 backend engineers covering authentication, data, and infrastructure, They use AWS for cloud services.

Shoppi's moat is their accumulated user list data. While their strategy includes giving customers a friction-free onboarding and a delightful user experience, the team believes that the app's real stickiness will come from using past lists to help users create new ones. This collection of user-generated list items would be the most difficult asset for a competitor to replicate.

Intelligent list completion
Shoppi's first step in this direction is to create a list completion feature. Once a list is begun, the app will suggest the next five items. Users can either accept, edit, or remove each item, after which another suggestion is added to the list, keeping the queue at five.

If done well, these suggested items will be exactly the ones the user had in mind, making the list creation experience faster and requiring less mental effort. If unsuccessful, these items will be a distraction, slowing the user down and degrading their experience.

Broadly speaking, there are three options for the algorithm behind making these list suggestions: A large language model (LLM), a recommender system, or a rule-based approach. They each have areas where they perform well and areas they struggle with. They are all widely used. The decision of which one Shoppi should use depends on the specifics of their situaion.

      Solving an easy RL problem on hard mode

    A story about a reinforcement learning approach learning to make a pendulum stand up straight, while making very few assumptions.

tl;dr
This is a demonstration of an RL approach that uses a combination of new tools to control a simulated pendulum:

BucketTree to learn a discretization of the pendulum’s continuous state variables, angle and angular velocity,
Ziptie to bundle the discretized values into discrete states,
Fuzzy Naive Cartographer (FNC) to learn common state-action-state sequences and to make conditional predictions of reward for each action.
It all runs in Myrtle, a real-time reinforcement learning workbench.

This approach requires only a little domain specific design and makes very few assumptions about its world.

The game: Inverting a pendulum

The goal of this work was to demonstrate a new method, not to top a leaderboard or solve a previously unsolved problem. Demonstrating a method is best done on a simple, familiar task where successful behavior is obvious and any deviations from that are similarly obvious and straightforward to dissect.

The playing field here is a pendulum. Imagine holding a broomstick by its one end. The goal is to invert the pendulum—to get it to stand straight up and stay there.
