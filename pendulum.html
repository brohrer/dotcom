<p>
A story about a reinforcement learning approach learning to make
a pendulum stand up straight, while making very few assumptions.
</p>

<h2>  tl;dr </h2>

<p>
This is a demonstration of an RL approach that uses a combination of new tools
to control a simulated pendulum:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/buckettree">BucketTree</a>
to learn a discretization of the pendulum’s continuous
state variables, angle and angular velocity,</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/ziptie">Ziptie</a>
to bundle the discretized values into discrete states,</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/fnc">Fuzzy Naive Cartographer</a>
(FNC) to learn common state-action-state sequences
and to make conditional predictions of reward for each action.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It all runs in <a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/myrtle">Myrtle</a>,
a real-time reinforcement learning workbench.
</p>

<p>
This approach requires only a little domain specific design
and makes very few assumptions about its world.

<h2>  The game: Inverting a pendulum </h2>

<p>
The goal of this work was to demonstrate a new method, not to top a leaderboard
or solve a previously unsolved problem. Demonstrating
a method is best done on a simple, familiar task where successful behavior
is obvious and any deviations from that are similarly obvious and straightforward
to dissect.
</p>

<p>
The playing field here is a pendulum. Imagine holding a broomstick by its
one end. The goal is to invert the pendulum&mdash;to get it to stand straight up
and stay there.

<p>
This is different from the popular
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/">cart-pole</a>
task where the base of the pendulum slides back and forth on a rail.
This post considers
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/pendulum/">a fixed-based pendulum</a>,
a straight arm with a pinned shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1085997475?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&embedded=true" width="660" height="400" frameborder="0"  allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" title="pendulum swinging"></iframe>
The pendulum in motion at 8 frames per second, the frequency at which the
agent gets updated on the pendulum's sensors and issues new action commands.
</p>

<h3>  Physics </h3>

<p>
The physical representation of the pendulum is simplistic.
The arm has uniform mass. It has a small amount of rotational friction,
proportional to its speed. And gravity acts on the pendulum's center of mass,
pulling it downward.
</p>

<p>
As always, the canonical source of information is
<a href="https://codeberg.org/brohrer/myrtle/src/branch/main/src/myrtle/worlds/pendulum.py">the code itself</a>.
</p>

<h3>  Sensors </h3>

<p>
There are two quantities returned by sensors: pendulum position and
rotational speed.
</p>

<p>
Position, &theta;,  is measured in radians, zero when pointing straight down,
&theta; = &pi;/2 when pointing to the right, $theta = &pi; when pointing upward, and
continuing around to almost 2&pi; when it reaches the bottom again and resets
to 0.
</p>

<p>
Angular speed, &omega;,  is measured in radians per second. Positive angular speed
is counter-clockwise (the direction of increasing position) and
negative speed is clockwise.
</p>

<h3>  Actions </h3>

<p>
Actions take the form of torque, &tau;,  applied to the base of the pendulum.
Positive torque accelerates the pendulum counter-clockwise, 
in the direction of increasing position. Negative torque accelerates it
in the clockwise direction.
</p>

<p>
Actions are discrete in time. Each action is a constant torque that
lasts for 1/8 second.
</p>

<p>
There are 13 discrete values the torque can take, 6 positive, 6 negative, and
zero. Possible torque values are distributed nonuniformly across the
range, with the middle half of the range having denser coverage. This results
in a finer grained representation of small torques, useful for making
fine-tuning adjustments.
</p>

<h3>  Reward </h3>

<p>
The pendulum returns reward, <em>r</em>,  related to how high the its swinging end reaches,
its vertical distance from its straight down &theta; = 0 position.
It reaches a maximum of <em>r</em> = 2 at the straight up &theta; = &pi; position.
A successful learning curve will work its way up to 2 and stay close to it.
</p>

covering short, medium, and longer term history.
</p>

<h2>  Cheat mode: Servo </h2>

<p>
We can skip every hard and interesting part of this problem by using a servo,
a motor and controller that take a desired position and drive the
pendulum arm directly to it. It hides the problem from us. Instead of taking
torque as an input and generating motion as an output,
a servo allows us to provide the final answer, and then tells us not
to look behind the curtain while it solves the problem for us. This is
usually done by gearing the drive motor down so far that
the pendulum dynamics become easy to ignore or by implementing
some kind of controller in a black box.
</p>

<p>
The servo solution is worth mentioning because it's common.
When working with a machine that’s big enough to hurt when it hits you,
it’s nice to know exactly where it’s going to be and when. This is one
of the reasons that reinforcement learning is not frequently used in robots.
(But also something I would love to change.)
</p>

<h2>  Level 1: Bang-bang control </h2>

<p>
One of the most straightforward ways to control a pendulum is
to sense whether it is to the right or to the left of its desired position
and apply the maximum torque the other direction. For some systems
this works remarkable remarkably well. It’s also straightforward
to implement. There’s no math other than a comparison with
the desired position.
</p>

<p>
Bang-bang control does require knowing a fair amount about your system, though.
</p>

<ol>
<li> It requires knowing which position is the desired position.
In a pendulum, the connection between position and reward is clear,
but in real systems, it can be quite complex. In robots, it’s likely
to involve the positions and velocities of many degrees of freedom,
and probably their time histories as well.</li>
<li> It requires knowing how the current state is related to the goal state
In the pendulum, it’s obvious that &theta; greater than &pi;
is past the goal in the counterclockwise direction while
&theta; less than &pi; is past the goal in the clockwise direction.
The relationship of every pendulum position to the goal is straightforward.
This isn’t always the case. Driving through the crisscross of one-way streets
that is downtown Boston demonstrates how the appearance of being close
to a goal may not reflect the realities. The distance as the crow flies
is only very loosely related to the actual driving distance, which itself
is only a very approximate approximately connected to the drive time.</li>
<li> It requires knowning which action will drive the system closer to its goal.
Again in the pendulum this is obvious, but even in systems with
two degress of freedom the connection becomes less obvious quickly.
Assuming that we know which actions drive a system to its goal is
a big assumption.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Bang-bang control in a pendulum, while effective, only works because
it allows us to build in a lot of implicit knowledge about how a pendulum works.
</p>

<h2>  Level 2: PD control </h2>

<p>
Bang-bang control is inelegant. When driving a car, bang bang control
would be having the accelerator fully depressed until you reach
your destination, at which point you instantly slam it into reverse.
It can be hard on your machine and on any humans involved.
It can also result in poor performance, overshoot of the goal,
and an audible "bang" when actuators switch instantly from
full speed ahead to full reverse.
</p>

<p>
A useful improvement over a bang bang is proportional-derivative (PD) control.
It gets around some of the more obnoxious shortcomings of bang-bang control
by adjusting its torque appropriately. The further away the pendulum is
from the goal, the greater the torque applied to move it back
(proportional control). And to help keep it stable, a small torque
is added in the direction opposite to that of the pendulum's
movement (derivative control), simulating friction.
</p>

<p>
Similarly to bang-bang control, PD-control
drives the pendulum directly to its target position, albeit less violently.
And like bang-bang control, it requires knowing which pendulum state
maps to maximum reward, where pendulum states are relative to each other,
and which actions move the pendulum from its current state to the goal
state.
</p>

<h2>  Level 3: Q-learning </h2>

<p>
The difficulty level goes up considerably if we take away knowledge
about which position is rewarded, where the current position is in
relation to it, and which action will move the system closer to its goal.
This is the difficulty level on which Q-learning operates.
</p>

<p>
Rather than working with continuous angular positions and velocties,
Q-learning works with a discretized state representation. Position is
chopped into discrete bins, as is velocity. Now, instead of &theta;
being able to take on any real value between 0 and 2&pi;, it has a
relatively small number of discrete options to choose from.
Similarly with &omega;. And because there are just a handful of
positions and velocities to choose from, we can list every possible
combination of them, together with every action that can be taken,
in one big table. Then, learning to control the pendulum becomes a task
of filling in the tabele&mdash;of trying every action 
in every state a few times and learning what
reward tends to occur.
</p>

<p>
This takes a while but it does eventually happen.
</p>

<p>

</figure>
</p>

<h2>  Level 4: Q-learning with curiosity </h2>

<p>
Q-learning is a classical reinforcement learning technique. It
relaxes all the assumptions and system knowledge required by PD or
bang-bang control. It does the job, but very slowly. The reason it is so
slow is &epsilon;-greedy exploration. At the very beginning of its life
the agent has no idea which actions are the most lucrative in any given
situation. Even so, it only spends a few percent of its time exploring.
And after millions of trials when it knows very well what to do, it still
spends a few percent of its time exploring, which prevents it from getting
very close to perfect behavior.
</p>

<p>
An alternative is exploration based on curiosity. There are many different
ways to describe and implement curiosity, but my favorite is one I rolled
myself. It assigns an explicit reward value to the knowledge gained
from trying something new. If an action has never been tried before,
uncertainty is high and it has a lot of potential value. There might
be a pony behind that door you've never opened. But by the time an
action has been tried seven times with the same result, it's unlikely that
trying it an eighth time will give a different result. You can keep
pressing the "walk" button but it's probably not going to change the light. 
</p>

<p>
In this implementation of curiosity,
the uncertainty associated with taking an action in a given
state is related to how many times that action has been tried in that state
already. More experience means lower uncertainty. Uncertainty gets collected
over time as curiosity about taking that action. Once that curiosity exceeds
the expected rewards of other alternatives, the agent tries that action
again, and the curiosity gets reset to zero.
</p>

<p>
This results in a whole lot of exploration when the agent is young,
but settles out quickly after every option has been tried a few times.
It also means that, for a given state, once a very successful action is
found others are much less likely to be experimented with.
</p>

<p>
A Q-learning agent that uses a curiosity strategy for exploration learns
much faster than from &epsilon;-learning.
</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1086240261?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&embedded=true" width="660" height="400" frameborder="0"  allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" title="pendulum swing under Q-learning with curiosity after learning"></iframe>
After 125K samples the pendulum settles into mostly upright position, with
occasional deviations as a long tail of exploratory actions play out.
</p>

<p>
Curiosity doesn't eliminate any of the assumptions made about the system,
but it does level up the performance.
</p>

<h2>  Level 5: Model learning FNC </h2>

<p>
It's also possible to level up Q-learning. Q-learning
updates its value function, 
the expected return from any state-action combination, by a small fraction
each time. The same action would need to performed at least
a dozen times in a given state before the learned value of that action
gets close to the actual expected reward.
</p>

<p>
But there is no need to be so cautious at first.
Initial learning rates can be very high.
It's reasonable to assume that whatever happens
the first time an action is tried in a situation will happen every time,
(a learning rate of 1). Then for the second action the learning rate
can be backed off, say to 1/2. This learning rate backoff continues
for the third, fourth and subsequent trials, until eventually it settles
in to some steady state learning rate floor, like 0.03.
</p>

<p>
A method called
<a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/fnc)(FNC">Fuzzy Naive Cartographer</a>
uses this trick to learn state-action values more quickly.
It is an approach I developed to learning state-action-state transition
world models, but it also learns a state-action-reward value function.
It uses both aggressive early learning rates and curiosity-driven
exploration to invert the pendulum in about 65,000 time steps.
</p>

<p>
<figure>
  <img title="The FNC learning curve is notably steeper than that of Q-learning." alt="The bottom plot shows a line that climbs steadily from 0.8 to
just short of 2.0 over about 65K time steps
" src="images/pendulum/reward_one_hot_fnc_pendulum.png">
  <figcaption>The FNC learning curve is notably steeper than that of Q-learning.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
Importantly, the gains that come from adding curiosity and aggressive
early learning rates do not require any specific domain knowledge
or assumptions. There is are subtle pendulum understandings built into
them. They apply equally well to any world.
</p>

<h2>  Level 6: Feature learning with Ziptie </h2>

<p>
We do however have some world-specific knowledge built in to how 
the state information is constructed. Each position value is paired with
each velocity value to create the whole set of unique states.
This seems like a very small step, and hardly any contribution of
domain knowledge for the pendulum, but for systems with a large number
of inputs, like an array of pressure sensors
or an image with thousands of pixels, the full list of every possible
combination would be imposible large. In this case
small collections of sensors&mdash;a
group of active pressure sensors here or a visible edge there&mdash;is a much
more useful set of features to learn from.
</p>

<p>
When these combinations of sensors are designed by a human, that's called
feature engineering, but when they are learned by an algorithm, that's
feature learning. Feature learning allows features to emerge from the patterns
that occur in the data itself, and do not rely on the intuition and biases
of a designer.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/ziptie">Ziptie</a> algorithm is developed
to solve exactly this problem. In the case of the pendulum, ziptie takes in all
the discrete pendulum positions and all the discrete velocity values and 
learns to pair every position with every velocity. It's an not really
necessary for a system as simple as the pendulum, but it is a way to
make the learning approach more agnostic to the world it is learning
to navigate.
</p>

<p>
<figure>
  <img title="Adding Ziptie to the system almost doubles the learning time." alt="The bottom plot shows a line that climbs steadily from 0.6 to
just over 1.9 over about 100K time steps, then closes the remaining
distance to 2.0 over the next 200K time steps
" src="images/pendulum/reward_ziptie_fnc_pendulum.png">
  <figcaption>Adding Ziptie to the system almost doubles the learning time.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
This is the first step at which we've had to make a tough trade-off.
Intentionally including fewer assumptions (how state features should
be constructed from raw sensors) makes the algorithm's job harder.
It has an extra level of structure to learn. Before it can even start
dialing in the optimal actions to take in each situation, it first has
to learn to recognize those position-velocity pairs that represent
each situation. The win is that the method is not stronger, more general.
It requires less built in knowledge. The cost of this win is an 
extra forty thousand time steps before performance gets close to optimal,
and the pendulum spends most of its time facing straight up.
</p>

<p>
This is exactly the trade-off this work is targeting. It's not about learning
to invert a pendulum. We've already seen there are easier ways to do that.
The goal is to be able to learn to control systems that we don't know
much about. Systems that are more complex or difficult to model.
That's where the real power is - not in learning to do one thing
better than everyone else but in learning to do more things at a B- level.
</p>

<p>
At this stage, it is helpful to note that
FNC also lets go of a common assumption, that every sensor observation
at every time step is relevant. Methods like Q-learning that list all
possible states in a table use a dense state representation&mdash;for two
states to be the same every value of every sensor must be identical.
If there are noisy sensors present that have no bearing on what action
should be taken, they will confuse the algorithm. It will fail to learn
from its experience because every experience will appear completely new.
FNC avoids this be treating each sensor value individually. Once it learns
the best torque to apply given a position/velocity combination a hundred
other irrelevant sensors won't prevent it from applying that knowledge.
Combined with Ziptie, FNC learns a minimal reduced-state representation
that is just rich enough to allow it to achieve its goals. This capability
is rare, if not unique.
</p>

<h2>  Hard mode: Discretization learning with BucketTree </h2>

<p>
Even though Ziptie does a good job learning to build features, it still
relies on position and angle measurements that have been carefully
discretized. A lot of domain knowledge goes into designing a good
discretization. 
</p>

<ul>
<li> How many discrete angle bins should there be?</li>
<li> Should angle be uniformly sliced?</li>
<li> Or should it be
divided more finely in the neighborhood of the twelve o'clock position,
to help it make the fine adjustments necessary to keep the pendulum vertical?</li>
<li> How many discrete velocities?</li>
<li> Should they be uniform or more densely divided near zero?</li>
<li> What are the largest velocities likely to be observed?</li>
</ul>

<p>
When I was writing this world I had to do a lot of trial and error
to find a discretization that was feasible to learn.
</p>

<p>
The next level of difficulty is to take away the designed discretization,
to just feed raw floating-point numbers as inputs and let the
discretized bins be learned automatically. This is where BucketTree
comes in.
</p>

<p>
BucketTree is a tree of buckets. The root bucket contains all the 
values from minus infinity to plus infinity. At the next level,
the bucket is split in two, which one bucket covering minus infinity to
the split, and the other covering from the split to plus infinity.
at the next level. And this continues for as many levels and
buckets as the tree is allowed to create. A BucketTree with <em>n</em> full
levels will have a total of 2^<em>n</em> - 1 buckets. The total number of
buckets allowed is specified at BucketTree creation.
</p>

<p>
This process also takes time. BucketTrees learn how to divide
and subdivide buckets by collecting observations. They also take care
not to jump the gun and create all their bins prematurely (say, in the 
neighborhood of the six o'clock position of the pendulum) before they
have had a chance to explore their world a little bit.
</p>

<p>
For the pendulum and its two continuous variables, learning a discretization
adds an extra forty thousand time steps to its learning process.
</p>

<p>
<figure>
  <img title="The addition of BucketTree discretizers results in a somewhat longer time period for learning, and a somewhat more up-and-down time course" alt="The bottom plot shows a line that makes a jagged climb from
1.0 to 1.9 over about 100K time steps
" src="images/pendulum/reward_buckettree_fnc_pendulum.png">
  <figcaption>The addition of BucketTree discretizers results in a somewhat longer time period for learning, and a somewhat more up-and-down time course</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
The bins that are created for each variable seem like a reasonable
representation of the space. With a maximum of 50 bins allowed for
both position, &theta; (sensor 1, on bottom),
and velocity, &omega; (sensor 0, on top), here's how they got
bucketed.
</p>

<p>
<figure>
  <img title="Position buckets on bottom, velocity buckets on top" alt="Two plots showing how position and velocity are subdivided into buckets
" src="images/pendulum/sensor_buckets_pendulum.png">
  <figcaption>Position buckets on bottom, velocity buckets on top</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
These plots show the hierarchical bucketing of each sensor.
The root bucket (level 0 in the plot) covers everything from infinity to minus infinity.
The next level (level -1 in the plot) has a single split, giving two child
buckets. Level -2 has 4 buckets, level -3 has 8, and so on.
The buckets in a single level are approximately evenly spaced,
but not exatly so. In both cases, the sensor ranges closest to
the reward state (&theta; = 3.14, &omega; = 0) are where it spends most
of its time, and so they get subdivided into finer and finer buckets.
</p>

<p>
Notably this doesn't slow the learning down very much.
This is probably because the
original, hand-designed discretization (equally spaced position bins
and semi-regularly spaced velocity bins) is denser than it
needs to be, particularly in regions far from the reward, resulting
in a larger state space.
</p>

<p>
But way more important than this, BucketTree means that the
agent doesn't care whether the sensors in the world are discrete,
continuous, or some of both. Whatever the case it will learn to handle
it. This is in contrast to every other
RL framework where you have to specify whether each sensor
is continuous or discrete and give the range of each. It removes a
whole stack of assumptions and domain knowledge that the vast majority
of approaches require.
</p>

<h2>  Harder mode: Real-time </h2>

<p>
Another assumption that many RL implementations make is that they have
all the compute time they need. Some approaches are quite computationally
expensive and can take a while for the agent to process all its sensor
information, evaluate its options, choose its next step, and update
all the paramters it is learning. During the time it takes to do this,
the world spins on. Motors are still driving, limbs are still swinging,
obstacles are still coming up fast. Agent processing time gets experienced
as a delay. Every action the world receives is based on sensor information
it sent in the past. Things have changed since then and what was the ideal
action then may no longer be.
</p>

<p>
This is the challenge of operating in real-time, grounded in a wall clock.
The whole pendulum exercise above has been completed with this real-time
constraint in force. I created the RL workbench
<a href="https://brandonrohrer.com/myrtle">Myrtle</a> to do exactly this.
</p>

<p>
Myrtle enforces real-time constraints by separating the world (the pendulum) and
agent (the learning algorithm) into separate processes. This allows them to
avoid blocking each other and to each use their own CPU core for processing
so they don't starve each other for compute. Every other support function
within Myrtle,
like logging, reporting, and serving browser animations, is performed
in yet another process, so that occassionally demanding processing steps
don't cause hiccups in the critical processes.
</p>

<p>
The world is the metronome
for the RL loop. It sends sensor information at a consistent pace
thanks to a <a href="https://github.com/brohrer/pacemaker">Pacemaker</a>, a precision
timekeeping tool. Although the pendulum in these examples is simulated,
that simulation is also tied to the wall clock. A high speed pacemaker
is used to govern the fine timesteps of the physics simulation behind it.
</p>

<p>
When working against the wall clock, it's helpful to measure how long
all the different parts of the cycle take. And it's helpful to measure
that over many cycles, because it will be slightly different each time.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The top plot shows the most recent few cycles in the RL loop, extending
from the current time, 0 ms, back to almost 100 ms ago. The bars show
phases of the cycle. The world bar shows the period between when it receives
an action and when it passes the next round of sensor information back
to the agent. In a perfectly fast RL system, the world bar would be solid
across cycles, with zero agent processing delay. In a real-time system
this will never be the case. But in this plot, it shows that the world
bar covers about 80% of the cycle, which is pretty good. It also shows
the agent processing time. Even for the BucketTree/Ziptie/FNC stack,
this is quick, a couple of milliseconds. Note that the most recent
agent bar is missing. This is due to the small delays incurred in the
logging process. It hasn't been recorded yet. A fine dotted line
marks the end of each world bar. This is the demarcation of a new cycle.
The sending of new sensor information to the agent occurs on time,
regardless of any delays that came before. The gaps between the agent
and world bars are the handoff times. Sensor and action information
are passed using Python's multiprocessing Queues, which are quite fast,
but the information still has to wait to be read by the recipient. Both the world
and agent check for new information on a regular cadence. It's quick, but
the letter sits in the mailbox for a few hundred microseconds.
</p>

<p>
The second and third plots are identical to the first, except that they
cover more and more cycles. This gives a chance for different patterns
and anomalies to become visible.
</p>

<p>
The fourth plot shows the distribution of the time per cycle.
The pendulum control loop is running at 8 cycles per second. Given the
physical dynamics of the pendulum, issuing motor torque commands 8 times
in a second is the sweet spot for being able to control it well.
Much faster than that and the effect of an action is hard to observe.
Much slower than that and the pendulum can swing way past where you
wanted it to go. Because I am impatient, the whole system is also running
with an 8x speedup. That means that it's able to squeeze 64 cycles into a second
while faithfully simulating the dynamics of the 8 cycle per second contol.
As a result, the total cycle time ends up being 1/64 seconds,
or 15.6 milliseconds. This plot demonstrates how carefully Myrtle is able
to maintain that cadence, with a sharp peak at 15.6.
</p>

<p>
The fifth through eighth plots break down this total cycle time into
its pieces
</p>

<ul>
<li> the handoff from the world to the agent (the gap between the world bar
and the agent bar)</li>
<li> the agent step time (the length of the agent bar)</li>
<li> the handoff from the agent to the world (the gap between the agent bar
and the world bar)</li>
<li> the world step time (the length of the world bar)</li>
</ul>

<p>
As expected, these distributions visually add up to the total cycle time.
What may not be expected is the structure of these. Handoffs show
a central tendency, but with a wide smear. Agent step is bi-modal,
probably showing large processing steps that occur during some iterations
and not others. And all the plots show small regularly spaced bumps,
indicating that sometimes things just take longer than expected,
and when they do it's usually by about 2 ms.
</p>

<h2>  Bonus points: Simple reward function </h2>

<p>
It's a minor point, but worth mentioning: Myrtle's pendulum is also using a simpler
reward function than the widely used
<a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/pendulum/#rewards">Gymnasium pendulum</a>.
Gymnasium as a fantastic resource with a wide variety of worlds for a RL
agent to try themselves against. The implementation of the Gymnasium pendulum
has a reward that includes a stiff penalty for moving quickly, as well
as a cost for taking large actions.
</p>

<p>
<code>-(&theta;^2 + &omega;^2/10 + &tau;^2/1000)</code>
</p>

<p>
(Note that &theta; in the Gymnasium pendulum is defined as zero in the upright
position, positive to the right and negative to the left.)
</p>

<p>
This formulation gives indirect hints to the agent about what strategies
it should adopt. It directly penalizes wild swings and hard twists.
It's not wrong to do this, but it is important to note that the
reward function is a common place for domain-specific knowledge and assumptions
to get baked into the algorithm. Removing these extraneous terms, as we have,
makes learning to control the pendulum a greater challenge. Definitely worthy
of some bonus points.
</p>

<h2>  Next level </h2>

<p>
There are some remaining parts of the system that are either assumed away
or hard coded. To get to a truly general solution, operating on
ultimate, no cheat-codes hard mode, I'll need to find a way for
the RL agent to learn all of these.
</p>

<h3>  Action discretization </h3>

<p>
The set of discrete actions available to the agent is extremely hard coded.
The <a href="https://codeberg.org/brohrer/myrtle/src/commit/7b957081a8e2e9372434ef14c80695fe32b6b9ac/src/myrtle/worlds/pendulum.py#L64">list of torque values</a>
was developed through trial and error and the learnability of the world
is sensitive to them. BucketTree is great at automatically discretizing
sensors, but the problem of learning useful action discretizations
is a tougher one. I'm uncomfortable having this much hard-coded domain
knowledge in the world. It is an itch in my brain. It is on my
to-do list to make this learnable as well.
</p>

<h3>  Time discretization </h3>

<p>
The cadence at which the world-agent RL loop runs is another magic number,
chosen through trial and error, and the learnability of the world depends
on it heavily. The representation of time is even more fundamental than
representing actions. How we choose to discretize time has a profound
effect on how agents and worlds can interact. It would be wonderful to
be able to learn a good discretization.
</p>

<p>
There is precedent for this. In numerical integration,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Adaptive_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">the Adaptive Runge&mdash;Kutta method
</a>
runs multiple estimates of a dynamic system at different orders, and 
it adjusts the time step so that the error differences between those
lower- and higher-order estimates stays in a given range. I still haven't
worked out how to apply this concept to RL, but it is also on my to-do list.
</p>

<h3>  Sequences and time-series </h3>

<p>
For many systems, it's not only the current set of sensor values that
determine what the next action should be, it's also the recent history
of them. Imagine a pendulum that has only a position sensor, but no
velocity. The velocity is important to know when deciding how much
torque to apply. While it can't be measured exactly in the position-only pendulum,
it can be estimated by looking at the last few positions and action torques.
</p>

<p>
The methods described here all assume that the current set of observations
are all that's needed for deciding the best action to take next, also
called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property">Markov Assumption</a>.
To become more general and play on yet harder levels, it will be
necessary to relax this assumption. This is something I'm working on
currently.
</p>

<p>
Dealing with sequences is likely to require some form of attention,
focusing on some sensors while ignoring others. The possible combinations
of sensor values grows exponentially with the number of time steps
included in the history. Attention is a way to filter down the sensor
values to the most relevant ones, keeping the problem tractable.
</p>

<h3>  Hyperparameters </h3>

<p>
So far I've conveniently avoided the fact that even when algorithms
like Ziptie and BucketTree learn to sidestep hard-coded domain knowledge,
they still have a few hard coded parameters of their own that govern their
behavior. For both of them it's important to choose the right capacity&mdash;the
maximum number of features that Ziptie can create and the limit on the
number of buckets that BucketTree can create. There are also thresholds
that determine how quickly new features and buckets get formed.
</p>

<p>
Learning discretizations and features involves a certain amount of
kicking the can down the road.
Even though I'm no longer hard coding pendulum-specific information,
I'm still hard coding the behaviors of the algorithms that learn them,
their hyperparameters.
But while the algorithms' performance is quite sensitive to their
hyperparameters, they can learn a broad swath of systems, far more
than just a single degree of freedom pendulum.
Learning the features of a system and learning the discretization of its
inputs make this approach applicable to far more systems than it would
be without them.
If there are still a few magic numbers to choose, then that's a small price
to pay.
</p>

<p>
The process of choosing those magic numbers, hyperparameter optimization,
is a popular machine learning topic. Typical approaches range from
sophisticated
Bayesian algorithms to simply trying everything. But by far the most common
approach is researchers trial-and-erroring their way into something that
works pretty well most of the time. This isn't a terrible way to go.
Often the hyperparameters have specific meanings, and the mental models
of the researchers let them intuit their way into good values much
faster than could be discovered by brute force.
</p>

<p>
Bayesian hyperparameter optimization falls on the side of improving
performance by building in
more domain knowledge (known in Bayesian circles as <em>priors</em>).
Exhaustive search falls on the other
side. It's horribly inefficient, but assumes nothing about the
way hyperparameters act or interact. A middle ground can be found in
<a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/evopowell.html">Evolutionary Powell's method</a>,
a method I created to randomly explore the hyperparameter space, but
in a way that is weighted toward the most successful runs seen so far.
</p>

<p>

  <figcaption>Evolutionary Powell's method in action</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
In this animated example the exploration proceeds along one dimension at
a time (in the spirit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell's_method) ">Powell's method</a> but
the selection of the starting point for each new dimension is
weighted according to the performance of its nearest evaluated neighbors.
</p>

<p>
I didn't set up hyperparameter optimization for these examples,
but this is the path I would use to avoid making assumptions and
hard-coding hyperparameters
</p>

<h3>  How far can this go? How assumption-free can we get? </h3>

<p>
A loosely related concept here is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">No Free Lunch Theorem</a>.
In a gross oversimplification, it states that if algorithm A performs better
than algorithm B on a task, there is another task for which the reverse
will be true. There is no algorithm which performs better on every possible
problem. The best you can do is identify the set of problems you care about
the most and look for algorithms that perform well on them, at the expense 
of all the others. In the case of controlling robots, we can definitely do this.
We don't need an approach that can learn to maximize reward on just any system.
There are a handful assumptions we can focus on,
</p>

<ol>
<li> physical systems and simulations of physical systems,</li>
<li> with length scales from a few millimeters to a few meters,</li>
<li> on time scales from a few milliseconds to a few days,</li>
<li> that are dominated by classical mechanics.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although this is a huge class of systems, it is an infinitessimal segment of
all possible control problems. This is good news. It means that even
with the No Free Lunch Theorem in effect it's conceivable to develop learning
approaches that perform pretty well across most of them. Which is exactly
what controlling a pendulum on hard mode is trying to do.
</p>

<p>
Ziptie, BucketTree, and FNC minimize the amount of problem-specific engineering that
needs to be done. They get us closer to the ultimate goal of a domain-agnostic
RL agent, a plug-and-play robot brain.
