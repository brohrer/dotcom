# Getting started with Arduino

## Why Arduino?

Arduino gives builders a gift--a way to bridge the gap between
code and the physical world. At the heart of every Arduino board is a
programmable [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller)
chip with names like
[ATMega2560](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf)
and
[ARM-Cortex-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M).
If you imagine a laptop, take away the screen and the keyboard, and
shrink everything else down to a miniature scale, you won't be too far away
from a microcontroller. 

Microcontrollers come in a single integrated circuit, like this.

![Renesas RA4M1, a.k.a. Arm速 Cortex速-M4](images/arduino/arm_cortex_m4.png "Renesas RA4M1, a.k.a. Arm速 Cortex速-M4")

Arduino helps out hobbyists by putting them on a larger board like this.

![Arm Cortex microcontroller in its native environment, an Arduino UNO R4 Minima

The Arduino board gives easy access to the tiny pins of the IC and makes it
possible to plug in standard connectors for power and USB communications.

What makes the microcontroller so powerful isn't its computational capabilities
(they are pretty pathetic compared to the processor in your phone). What makes
it special is the large collection of input/output pins.

- **Digital I/O** pins which can pass high (3.3 or 5 Volts
depending on the board) and low (0 Volt) signals
to another circuit, as well as read high and low signals from them.
- **Analog input** pins, which use an analog-to-digital converter to read
the voltage from an outside source to a fine resolution.
- **Analog output** (DAC) pins, which use a digital-to-analog converter to sustain
a pin at any voltage from a near-continuous range.
- **PWM** ([Pulse-width modulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation))
pins, which approximate an analog voltage by rapidly switching
back and forth between high and low voltages. For example, to maintain an
average voltage of 2.2 Volts, a PWM signal will switch between 0 and 3.3 Volts,
spending two-thirds of its time at 3.3 V and one-third of its time at 0 V.
- Specialized communication protocol pins, like UART, CAN, I2C, and SPI.

### Shields and Carriers

A microcontroller on its own is cool in concept, but isn't particularly useful.
Arduino makes it easy to extend them by adding on other components.
These extension boards can be stacked below (**carriers**) or above
(**shields**) the Arduino boards on rows of carefully laid out pins.
Shields seem to be much more common than carriers.

![A stack of Arduino boards
](images/arduino/arduino_stack.jpg "from https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Arduino")

Shields give you a huge Swiss Army knife of tools

- Ethernet
- WiFi (although some boards come with this)
- Extra memory
- Relay switches
- Motor controllers
- Temperature other environmental sensors
- Inertial measurement units
- Microphone and some speech processing
- Camera and some vision processing
- LED and LCD displays

### Models and form factors

There are a handful of different form factors with names like UNO, MKR,
Portenta, Nano, and Giga. 
Here is [a really helpful breakdown of the different boards
](https://www.pleasedontcode.com/blog/arduino-boards-comparison-a-selection-guideline)
and some of the shields and carriers that go with them.
When in doubt, start with
[the latest UNO base](https://store.arduino.cc/collections/uno/products/uno-r4-minima)
and build from there. UNO
is meant to be a somewhat universal starting point.

Most Arduino boards and shield are physically compatible, although
[this post on the Arduino forum
](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/4456/are-all-arduino-shields-compatible-with-all-arduino-boards)
strong encourages us to check the voltage (3.3 V vs 5 V) compatibility
and the software library compatibility as well.

Because all Arduino designs are open, there are a large number of
[Arduino-compatible
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems),
Arduino-adjacent, and Arduino spinoff boards and shields.
It can all get a little overwhelming. It's the downside of not having a
single corporate overlord dictating a conveniently consumable lineup
of marketing-approved SKUs. Read item descriptions and blog posts carefully,
prepare for some thoughtful trial and error, and embrace the anarchy.

### The IDE

The easiest way to start giving the microprocessor instructions to execute
is to use the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
You can [download it](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) for Linux, MacOS,
and Windows. It's free thanks to the generous folks behind it, but consider
leaving a donation to keep the lights on.

After you install and open it, the IDE takes you right to a code editor
window.

![Screenshot of the Arduino IDE showing a code editing window
](images/arduino/arduino_ide.png "The starting screen on the Arduino IDE")

There are two major versions of IDE - 1.x and 2.x.
Version 1 is a little more bare bones, version 2 has fancy touches
like autocomplete, function definitions, and dark mode. They'll both let you
do what you need to do. You can try either or both and switch between them.

I also recommend bookmarking 
[the Arduino IDE documentation page](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide/),
which covers both versions.

![Screenshot of the Arduino IDE documentation page
](images/arduino/arduino_ide_docs.png)

### Connecting the board

The next step is to get the computer with with the IDE connected to the board.
Most boards come with a power jack and a USB jack. Plug the power into the
power cord that comes with the board, and connect a USB cable from
your computer with the IDE to the USB jack on the board.

![An Arduino board plugged in to power and USB
](images/arduino/plugged_in.jpg "USB and power cords connected")

In the IDE menu select `Tools` -> `Board` and choose your board model.
Then select `Tools` -> `Port` and select the port it's connect to.
On mine, the right port identifies itself as being attached to the Arduino
board. Now you are ready to start with code.

### A first program

Luckily the IDE also has a lot of example code. In the IDE go to
`File` -> `Examples` -> `01.Basics` -> `Blink`.

![A view of the Blink.ino code in the Arduino IDE
](images/arduino/blink_ide.png)

This is a bit of C code that blinks a LED on the board.

To check whether it compiles without errors, you can click the checkmark icon
in the upper left hand corner of the window.

To upload the code to the board
and run it you can click the right arrow icon in the upper right hand corner
of the window.

And if everything goes to plan, a green LED on your board will start blinking
slowly.

TA DA!

^[Blink works as advertised

### Uploading, in detail

Several important things just happened behind the scenes.

1. The `Build.ino` got cleaned up into a proper C++ file.
2. A compiler turned it into a binary file of raw instruction instructions
for the microprocessor in the form of a `.hex` file. For the curious,
this is a nice
[detailed description of the preoprocessing and compilation steps
](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/sketch-build-process/)
3. The `.hex` file was uploaded over the USB cable onto the
[bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader)
on the Arduino board. The bootloader holds the instructions that get run
automatically by the microprocessor when it is rebooted.
Here's a deeper dive into
[how the bootloader works](https://gist.github.com/baalexander/8530398).
4. The microprocessor is rebooted and the new instructions are run.

![Block diagram illustrating the four steps listed above](images/arduino/upload_process.png)

The fact that so many steps happened with so little effort on our part is
what the Arduino effort has brought to microprocessor development.
You can do all these yourself with any microprocessor you want, but
you have to manually include all the necessary libraries, compile
the code, and manage the bootloader writing. You also have to create
the board for the microprocessor to live on, and make sure that it has power,
input and ouput connections, and the auxiliary chip it needs to talk USB.
The fact that Arduino makes that process 100 times easier is a credit to
the developers and an excellent reason to start your microprocessor
adventures with an Arduino board. (They don't pay me to say that.)

### The blink code

The `Blink.ino` is almost a valid C++ program, but it gets some
Arduino-specific `#include` lines added to the top before compiling.
In Arduino talk, an `.ino` file, its supporting files, and the directory
they are in are collectively called a **sketch**.

The structure is important. The compiler is looking for two files in
particular.

- `setup()`, which runs once when you press reset or plug in the board.
- `loop()`, which runs again and again until you forcibly stop it.

Both of these functions return no result.
The code we ran shows how this gets put together.

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
} <br>
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}
```

The pre-defined constants scattered through the code--`LED_BUILTIN`, `OUTPUT`,
`HIGH`, `LOW`--are defined in the header files that automatically added
to this one before it is compiled. Thanks to the fact that the board
has already been selected in the IDE, these constants are specific to
the board we are working with. Having them added in automatically is another
tedious and error prone step that Arduino takes care of.

I found the book [Programming Arduino: Getting Started with Sketches
](https://simonmonk.org/prog-arduino-3ed)
by [Simon Monk](https://simonmonk.org) to be immensely helpful.
Even if you're already familiar with C and programming, it's a quick way
to get oriented in Arduino programming. And if you're not, it's a gentle
but non-patronizing introduction.

### Printing

The most awksward part of having a tiny computer with no screen is that
you can't see what's happening as it runs. Luckily the Arduino folks
thought of that too and gave us the
[Serial.print()
](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/serial/print/)
function. You can slip this into your program and it will print
to your IDE, back on your laptop.

Getting printing up and running requires the seial port connection to
be initialized in `setup()`
```
Serial.begin(9600); // open the serial port at 9600 bps
```
and then called in `loop()`
```
Serial.print("blink");
```

To view the printed text, open the Serial Monitor. From the IDE menu
go to `Tools` -> `Serial Monitor`. You'll have to select your board
and port again.

We can take the extra step to initialize a counter at the beginning of
the program
```
int blink_counter = 0;
```
and then print it and increment it in each iteration
```
Serial.print(blink_counter);
blink_counter ++;
```

Here's the resulting program
```
int blink_counter = 0; <br>
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600); // open the serial port at 9600 bps:
} <br>
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  Serial.print("blink");
  Serial.print(blink_counter);
  Serial.print("\n");
  blink_counter ++; <br>
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}
```

and here is the printing in action.

^[Counting blinks in the IDE

It looks like a small thing in the video but feels SO big when you get it
running on your own desk.

We covered a lot of ground in a short time - Arduino boards and shields,
the IDE, coding, compiling, uploading, and printing to the console.
It's a solid start. The sky's the limit now!
