# Getting started with Arduino

## Why Arduino?

Arduino gives builders a gift--a way to bridge the gap between
code and the physical world. At the heart of every Arduino board is a
programmable [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller)
chip with names like
[ATMega2560](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf)
and
[ARM-Cortex-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M).
If you imagine a laptop, take away the screen and the keyboard, and
shrink everything else down to a miniature scale, you won't be too far away
from a microcontroller.
