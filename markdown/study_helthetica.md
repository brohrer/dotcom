# Build or buy your data stack?

## Summary

## Scenario

Helthetica is a small bootstrapped company building a virtual
interactive health coach. The coach is an app that provides suggestions,
reminders, and encouragement throughout the day.
Eventually it will provide recommendations for reaching training
and fitness goals, as well as calling users' attention to concerning trends.
Early mockups and proofs of concept have been well received. The MVP has
generated almost 60,000 users at $49 per month.

Helthetica's app integrates with varied data sources--calendars, pill schedules,
eating and drinking logs, activity journals, recorded performance goals, and
physiological activity monitoring through GPS, glucose
monitors, heart rate, and blood oxygen monitors.

The Helthetica team is small - just 13 people. You are the CTO and 
VP of engineering with two dedicated data engineers on your team.
The data engineering infrastructure behind the MVP was hacked together quickly
and is starting to break down regularly under the current load.
It needs a full makeover. Your job is to to redesign it.
