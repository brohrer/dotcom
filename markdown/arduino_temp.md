# Interrogating Arduino temperature sensors

My favorite joke about sensors is a variant of
[Segal's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segal's_law).

```
If you have a watch you always know what time it is.
If you have two watches, you're never sure.
```

It's depressingly applicable to electromechanical systems. Once you can
read a sensor, you suddenly have ten thousand watches.

### Sensors aren't perfect

You may not be aware of it, but when you have just one watch you tend
to have a particular mental model of how it's related to the actual time.

![A diagram depicting the world time connected with an arrow to a watch
](images/arduino_temp/trivial_model.png "In a the simplest model of measurement, the time on the watch is the same as the actual time.")

![A diagram depicting the world time connected with an arrow to an icon
depicting measurement, a pair of old school calipers, which is connected by
two other arrows to two wristwatches
](images/arduino_temp/measurement_model.png "In practice, the measurement and tracking of time is a little messier.")

Measuring a thing introduces errors and imperfections. This is immediately
apparent when working with temperature. If I have one thermometer,
I can confidently report that I know what the temperature is.

![A photo of a thermometer showing the temperature
](images/arduino_temp/one_thermometer.jpg)

But if I have five of them, I'm no longer sure.

![A photo of five thermometers, each showing a slightly different temperature
](images/arduino_temp/five_thermometers.png)

Presumably all these thermometers are sitting at the same temperature,
inches apart on the same desk in the same room.
Some weirdness has been introduced in the process of measuring it though.

This introduces some troubling questions. Where is this weirdness coming from?
Can we correct for it? And more fundamentally, what even is the real temperature?

We'll spend the rest of this post trying to answer them.

### Connecting to an Arduino

To really scale up our investigation of measurement, we're going to
~~place an order for a million thermometers~~ connect a computer
to a digital thermometer.
The [Arduino UNO Wifi Rev 2](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-wifi-rev2/)
is a board containing, among other things, a microcontroller and a temperature
sensor. If this is your first exposure to Arduino and you'd like to get
started with your own, you can
[take a side road here](https://brandonrohrer.com/arduino.html)
and come back.

After plugging in the Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev2, we’ll need to search for and
download the library that lets us measure temperature. The temperature
sensor is part of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) chip tucked unobtrusively
into the cityscape of the board. 

![A photo of the UNO Wi-Fi Rev2 showing the microprocessor and IMU
](images/arduino_temp/imu.png "The IMU is a tiny chip, 2 1/2 by 3 mm, about 1/8 by 1/10 inch")

The chip is the LSM6DS3 from a company called [ST](https://www.st.com) and 
the library is called `Arduino_LSM6DS3`. To download it to the Arduino IDE,
navigate to `Tools` -> `Manage Libraries...`

![Screenshot of the menu option Manage Libraries highighted
](images/arduino_temp/manage_libraries.png)

and search for "LSM6" in the dialog.

![Screenshot of the library search dialog with LSM6DS3 in the search bar
and the top result as Arduino_LSM6DS3
](images/arduino_temp/install_library.png)

Click `Install` and we're all set up.

The IMU does several cool things, including measure acceleration
side-to-side (X), front-to-back (Y), and up-and-down (Z).
It also measures how fast the board is rotating in all three
[principal directions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes)
pitch (X), roll (Y), and yaw (Z). Yaw is the motion of shaking your head No,
pitch is shaking your head Yes, and roll is tilting your head side to side
like a begging puppy. Because the tiny mechanisms that make these
measurements are temperature sensitive, the board includes its own
temperature sensor, which is then used to make some adjustments.
Lucky for us, we can also query it directly.

The capabilities that this library opens up our listed in the
[application programmer interface (API) documentation
](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_LSM6DS3/blob/master/docs/api.md).
This is a list of the publicly available functions of the library. When you develop
a library and include a function description in the API documentation,
you are implying that it will always be available,
or at the very least that it won’t change. And in the event that you do
need to make a change to the official API, you do it with a lot of
communication and hoopla.

It's worth calling out that the links for `Arduino_LSM6DS3` library information
in the Arduino document library are broken at the moment I'm writing this.
That may be because they are a few years old or may be because someone
made a change somewhere in the documentation generation code that broke them.
Luckily, since Arduino is an open source project, we can go right to
the source--[the Github repository
](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_LSM6DS3/tree/master) where
it's all kept. That has the added bonus of never getting stale because
it is the ground truth.

You may notice in the list of functions available
that there is no way to access temperature from the API.
Some additional searches show that there is a way
[get temperature](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_LSM6DS3/blob/master/examples/SimpleTempSensor/SimpleTempSensor.ino)
using in the library, it’s just not included in the official documentation.
Using undocumented aspects of a library is a bit of a gamble.
They have no implied promise of consistency or support.
But since the only customers that are going to depend on the code
we write are ourselves, we are in a good position to acknowledge
and accept this risk. For what it’s worth, building on undocumented
behavior happens a lot.

![Every change breaks someone's workflow
](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png "from Randall Monroe at https://xkcd.com/1172/")

The function we want is called `readTemperature()`, and our searches
also pulled up some example code for how to use it.

```#include &lt;Arduino_LSM6DS3.h&gt; <br>
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial); <br>
  if (!IMU.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Failed to initialize IMU!"); <br>
    while (1);
  } <br>
  Serial.print("Temperature sensor sample rate = ");
  Serial.print(IMU.temperatureSampleRate());
  Serial.println(" Hz");
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("Temperature reading in degrees C");
} <br>
void loop() {
  float t; <br>
  if (IMU.temperatureAvailable()) {
    // after IMU.readTemperature() returns, t will contain the temperature reading
    IMU.readTemperature(t); <br>
    Serial.println(t);
  }
}```

The most important things to take away for our own code are:

Include the library header file.
```#include &lt;Arduino_LSM6DS3.h&gt;```

Initialize the IMU in the `setup()` block.
```IMU.begin()```

Then read the temperature as often as we want in the `loop()` block.
Each time, first check whether there is a temperature measurement available.
```if (IMU.temperatureAvailable()) {...```

Then get a reading.
```IMU.readTemperature(t);```

This is the heart of the temperature-getting operation.
`IMU.readTemperature(t) takes a single input argument, a `float`,
whose value it modifies to hold the temperature in degrees C.

The `Serial.print()` function lets us keep an eye on the result,
as long as we keep the USB cable connected to the board. The line

```Serial.begin(9600);```

kicks off a serial bus connection between the laptop and the board
at baud rate (bits per second) of 9600. To watch what they talk about
on this connection, we need a serial port monitor. Luckily the Arduino IDE
comes with one built right in. To use it select `Tools` -> `Serial Monitor`

![screenshot of the Serial Monitor selection in the Tools dropdown](images/arduino_temp/serial_monitor_select.png)

and on the far right of the Serial Monitor window that pops up,
make sure that `9600 baud` is selected in the dropdown menu.

![screenshot of the Serial Monitor window](images/arduino_temp/baud_select.png)

And now we’re ready to take a measurement.
[Here's the actual code I'm using.](https://github.com/brohrer/arduinobots/blob/main/sketches/uno_wifi_rev2_sensor_test/uno_wifi_rev2_sensor_test.ino)

### Reading the temperature

After clicking the compile-and-upload arrow this line shows up in the
Serial Monitor

```20.832 (69.498)```

And just like that, we know what temperature the world is at
in this location and at this time! About 20.8 degrees Celsius or 
69.5 degrees Farenheit. It is consistent with the most straightforward
interpretation of measurement we can come up with.

![An icon of a thermometer labeled "world temperature" and an icon of dial
labeled "measured temperature"](images/arduino_temp/trivial_temp_model.png)

The fun begins when we take another measurement ten seconds later.

```21.281 (70.306)```

Immediately panic sets in.

Did we change something?<br>
Did the temperature really go up?<br>
Was it wrong the first time?<br>
Was it wrong the second time?<br>
What is wrong both times???

There's no way to know. All we know is that we took one measurement
and then we took another, and they were different numbers.
This suggests that the measurement process is sophisticated enough
to merit special consideration.

a pair of antique calipers labeled "measurement process" which is pointing
to two icons of dials
labeled "measured temperature](images/arduino_temp/temp_model.png)

### Going deeper

It only gets worse as we collect additional measurements every few seconds.

```21.512 (70.721)
21.832 (71.298)
22.047 (71.684)
22.410 (72.338)
22.805 (73.048)
22.957 (73.323)
23.223 (73.801)
23.434 (74.180)
23.672 (74.609)
23.898 (75.017)
24.133 (75.439)
24.363 (75.854)
24.785 (76.613)
24.441 (75.995)
24.492 (76.086)
24.711 (76.480)
24.770 (76.585)
24.977 (76.958)
25.461 (77.830)```

The temperature keeps going up. We've watched it climb almost
5$deg$C (9$deg$F) in just a few minutes and there's no sign that
it's slowing down.

With an extended pattern like this it's really helpful to be able
to take regular readings and look at how they change over time.
There is
[a tweaked version of the code
](https://codeberg.org/brohrer/arduinobots/src/branch/main/sketches/uno_wifi_rev2_read_temp/uno_wifi_rev2_read_temp.ino) 
that reads the temperature on a regular cadence, and there is the Serial Plotter
a convenient Arduino IDE display of any value that gets regularly
sent to the Serial Monitor. Open the Serial Plotter via `Tools` ->
`Serial Plotter`. 

Starting from an Arduino that had been powered down overnight,
reading the temperature every 10 seconds, the first 8 minutes (48 readings) 
show a steady climb over almost 3$deg$C. 

![A plot showing 48 measurements in an upward curve starting at 23.6 and rising
to 26.4](images/arduino_temp/temp_rise_8_min.png)

One limitation of the Serial Plotter is that it
only plots the 50 most recent data points.
The next couple of screenshots extend this curve over about 24 minutes,
but the y-axis scale changes on each one.

![A plot showing 50 measurements in an upward curve starting at 26.45 and rising
to 27.0](images/arduino_temp/temp_rise_16_min.png)

![A plot showing 50 measurements in an upward curve starting at 27.0 and rising
to 27.3](images/arduino_temp/temp_rise_24_min.png)

This pattern gives us a solid lead. For some reason the reported
temperature is definitely going up, and not just a little bit.
This is exciting! It is a clear signal that *something* is going on.
We just don't know what.

### Modeling measurement

A cynical but pragmatic view of science is that its goal is to explain
what we see. A good theory explains everything we see. (And
[Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor)
suggests that it's good practice to go with the simplest
explanation we can come up with.)
Another word for such an explanation is a **model**, and the most important
ingredients in a good model are careful observations.

To get some more observations for our model, I set the stage more carefully.
In the quiet of the morning with no air conditioning, after the Arduino
had cooled all night, I started collecting measurements every 20 seconds.
Due to operator error, I lost the first few measurements on the plot, but
they began close to 21.5$deg$C.

![A plot showing 50 measurements in an upward curve starting at 22.7 and rising
to 25.1](images/arduino_temp/temp_rise_17_min.png)

This curve tells us a lot, and helps us to start building our measurement model.
The steep start, easing into a plateau is a common curve in systems that
get hit with a sudden change but take a while to adjust to it. Eventually
that line will flatten out and settle in to the new normal.

This raises the question of What changed? The only
change I made was to plug in the Arduino and start collecting measurements.
Using the inductive (storytelling) superpowers of a human brain,
we can connect the unusual events together--plugging in the Arduino probably
caused the temperature to rise.

Although these aren't obviously connected, the relationship does make sense
after more careful consideration. Powering up the Arduino sends electrical
current through the IMU chip and through the microprocessor that sits just
a couple of centimeters away. Current heats them both up a little bit.
And unlike devices intended to measure air temperature, the temperature
sensor of the IMU sits isolated from the air, on a piece of silicon
with a lot of transistors and resistors that are each generating a small
amount of heat. These will cause the temperature of the integrated circuit
package to rise, until it gets warmer than the surrounding air, enough so
that the difference in temperatures helps it dump its extra heat.

With this picture of what's going on, we can update our measurement model.

![Temperature measurement model, in icons, with a new IC power dissipation
icon pointing to the measurement process icon
](images/arduino_temp/temp_model_heating.png)

We could go down the rabbit hole of explicitly modeling the
temperature change due to internal heating of the
chip and how quickly it changes over time, explaining the precise curve of
the temperature readings as they climb in an exponential decay that
asymptomptotically approaches their new steady state,
but that way madness lies. And the field of heat transfer.

For our purposes, it's enough to measure the difference that it settles in at.
How much warmer does the chip need to be than its surroundings to be
at a stable temperature? For comparison, I placed a collection of
supposedly identical thermometers around the Arduino. They apparently have
their own measurement processes going on, because after sitting in the same
location all night they give slightly different readings. For comparing
with the Arduino, it will be enough to take the middle value, the median,
and treat that as the "world temperature".

![Seven thermometers lined up on a desk behind an Arduino, all reading about
21 degrees C
](images/arduino_temp/seven_thermometers.jpg "The humidity sensors are wildly wrong in two of them. Try to ignore them.")

After running this collection process for an hour, this temperature difference
settles in to 3.9$deg$C (7.0$deg$F). Making another run where temperature
is measured ten times per second gives the same result. This suggests
that the heating comes from having the Arduino powered on and is not
sensitive to computational load, at least not within the accuracy of my
air temperature sensors.

This measurement model is specific enough that it can be written in math.

![temp measured equals temp world plus delta heating](images/arduino_temp/temp_model_heating_eq.png)

where

![delta heating equals 3.9 degrees C](images/arduino_temp/delta_heating_eq.png)

This is a very useful temperature model. It starts to get us a somewhat
accurate way to connect measured temperature to the actual temperature in
the physical world.

## Convection

During the process of characterizing the internal heating,
another measurement quirk emerged when the air conditioner kicked on and off.

![A plot showing the temperature cycling between about 26 and 29 degrees C
](images/arduino_temp/air_conditioning.png)

The 3.9$deg$C difference between
the room air temperature and the measured temperature persisted,
except for when the air conditioning turned on. That caused a barely
perceptible breeze to blow, which apparently helped the chip dissipate
its heat more quickly and brought the temperature difference down to
2.0$deg$C. When the air is still the chip builds up a little bubble
of warmed air around itself that serves to insulate it and lets its
temperature rise higher than the air in the room around it. But
when the air conditioner runs, the gentle breeze keeps displacing this
bubble of air as fast as it can form. This process is called
*convection* and is the reason there are fans in our laptops.

Adding the effect of convection makes our measurement model even more
accurate (and complex).

![temp measured equals temp world plus delta heating and delta convection
](images/arduino_temp/temp_model_convection.png)

The new equation for the measurement model includes a convection term.

![temp measured equals temp world plus delta heating plus delta convection](images/arduino_temp/temp_model_convection_eq.png)

where

![delta convection equals minus 1.9 degrees C](images/arduino_temp/delta_convection_eq.png)

A more accurate model of convection would include the speed of the air blowing
over the IC and the temperature difference between the two, but that's
more detail than we need to get a good temperature estimate
in this particular situation. (Heat transfer is sneakily tryinging to get back
into the conversation here.)

## Noise

At this point, the measurement model does a pretty good job capturing the
temperature trends, but we have pointedly ignored the fact that there
is always a jaggedness to the measurement line. After we let the
chip warm up and make sure there is no air conditioning, the measurements
should be almost perfectly flat, but still they jump around by almost a degree.

These measurements are 120 seconds apart. Maybe the temperature really
is jumping around that quickly? If it is, we can speed up the measurements
and see whether they turn into smooth up-and-down wiggles.

At one per second they do not.

![A jaggedy line jumping up and down over about 0.06 degrees C
](images/arduino_temp/noise_1hz.png)

At ten per second they still don't.

![A jaggedy line jumping up and down over about 0.06 degrees C
](images/arduino_temp/noise_10hz.png)

The sampling rate of for temp on the chip is 52 Hz. So that's as fast
as we can check. Even at that speed they do not turn smooth.

![A jaggedy line jumping up and down over about 0.06 degrees C
](images/arduino_temp/noise_52hz.png)

Instead, it seems that there is some inherent jitter, some inaccuracy
that is built in to the measurement. The technical term for this is **noise**.
The philosophical term for this is [aleatoric uncertainty
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification#Aleatoric_and_epistemic).
The word is derived from the Latin for *dice* indicating
that there are some wiggles in the chart which are unavoidably random,
a roll of the dice.

## Filtering

More noise makes it harder to accurately read the underlying signal.
Reducing noise is the subject of much study in electrical engineering
and signal processing. 

We'll take a shallow dip into this bag of tricks for this by making a low
pass filter. This particular approach goes by many names. It's a weighted
average, with higher weights given to more recent measurements.
It's a leaky integrator. It's a first-order low-pass infinite impulse response
discrete-time filter.
It's [the easiest filter to implement
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Difference_equation_through_discrete_time_sampling)
so it gets used a lot in practical systems.

To low-pass filter the temperature, each new measurement gets combined with
the running estimate in a lop-side ratio. That ratio can be thought of as
an adaptation rate, say 0.1. Then each new measurement gets multiplied 
by 0.1 and added to the previous estimate, multiplied by 0.9, to get
the new estimate.

Expressed as an equation

![new filtered temp equals one minus adaptation rate times previous
filtered temp plus adaptation rate times new measurement
](images/arduino_temp/low_pass_eq.png)


[code](https://codeberg.org/brohrer/arduinobots/src/branch/main/sketches/uno_wifi_rev2_temp_lo_pass/uno_wifi_rev2_temp_lo_pass.ino)

```temp_filtered = (1.0 - adaptation_rate) * temp_filtered + adaptation_rate * temp_measured;```
