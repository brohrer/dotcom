logged eating and drinking, logging specific activities and performance goals,
activity monitoring through phone, glucose
monitors, heart rate and blood oxygen through fitness trackers.
An interactive health coach, provides suggestions,
reminders, encouragement throughout the day.
Eventually it will provide recommendations for reaching training
and fitness goals, as well as calling users' attention to concerning trends.
Early mockups and proofs of concept have been well received. MVP
generated almost 60,000 users at $49 per month.

The Helthetica team is small - just 13 people. You are the CTO and 
VP of engineering with two dedeicated data engineers on your team.
The data engineering infrastructure behind the MVP was hacked together quickly
and is starting to break down regularly under the current load.
