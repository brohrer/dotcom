            How to Train Your Robot is a long term side project.
            I've been working on it in some form for 20 years.
            My lifetime goal is to make a robot as smart as my pup.
            It's a long road, but it has a lot of fascinating stops like
            machine learning, Python development, software engineering,
            and robotics. Come join me.
