<h2>Why bother with HTTP?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of reasons you might want to get two computers talking
to each other,
and HTTP is a good way to make this happen. It's used to share web pages
of course (the name "hypertext transfer protocol" describes
this use case directly) but it can be used to share all kinds of other
data too&mdash;all varieties of text, image, audio, and video formats.
Just imagine all the shenanigans you can orchestrate with this power.</p>

<p>In the world of computer networking
getting computers talking the same language (a.k.a. protocol)
is the first step. Some protocols are very niche, intended for tasks
like reading oxygen sensors in combustion engines or controlling the
environment in office buildings. In contrast, HTTP is a general
purpose networking protocol. It pays the price of longer messages
and a more complex standard in order to fill lots of different needs.
It's a Swiss Army knife rather than a scalpel. It is said that Python
is the second-best programming language for every task.
The same could be said about HTTP for networking.</p>

<p>
This post is an attempt to give some guide posts through the terrain,
but the world of HTTP is wide and has a lot of history and hidden
corners. Everything written here is oversimplified, and some of it
is probably wrong, but I hope you find it useful.
</p>

<h2>Clients and servers,<br>requests and responses</h2>
<p>When two computers talk using HTTP, one is always the client
and the other is the server. The client initiates the conversation
by sending a specific message with a specific format called a request.
The server takes that request, does whatever it is that the
server needs to do, and replies with another specific message
format called a response. (If you're looking for a post on how
to write an HTTP server,
<a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/http_server.html">check here</a>.)</p>
<p>Request messages have three parts</p>
<ol>
<li>a request to do something</li>
<li>some headers</li>
<li>a body, also called a payload</li>
</ol>
<p>Response messages also have three parts</p>
<ol>
<li>a status report</li>
<li>some headers</li>
<li>a body (payload)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are writing a client, you'll need to take care
of composing requests and interpreting responses. The opposite is true
if you are writing a server.</p>

<h2>Some Python</h2>
<p>Here's an example that will showcase the building blocks.
It's an HTTP client that calls a server that performs addition.</p>
<pre><code>from http.client import HTTPConnection
import json

host = "192.168.1.42"
port = 8000
conn = HTTPConnection(host, port)

def call_addition_server(a, b):
    body_dict = {"val_a": a, "val_b": b}
    body = json.dumps(body_dict).encode('utf-8')
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Content-Length': len(body),
    }
    conn.request("GET", "/", body, headers)

    response = conn.getresponse()
    if response.status == 200:
        content_length = int(response.getheader('Content-Length'))
        return json.loads(response.read(content_length).decode('utf-8'))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = 25
    b = 13
    print(call_addition_server(a, b))
</code></pre>
<p>Starting from the imports</p>
<pre><code>from http.client import HTTPConnection
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>HTTPConnection</code> class from the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html">
http.client library</a> is immensely helpful for creating
requests and interpreting responses. In the client it's only
directly called when creating the connection to the server.</p>
<pre><code>host = "192.168.1.20"
port = 8000
conn = HTTPConnection(host, port)
</code></pre>
<p><code>HTTPConnection</code>
expects a host name, like <code>en.wikipedia.org</code>
or <code>192.168.0.1</code> and an optional port number,
although it will default to port 80, the default http port
of the internet, if no port is supplied. The server needs to be
running and reachable or else an attempt to connect with it will
generate a <code>ConnectionRefusedError</code>.</p>

<h2>Request body</h2>
<p>HTTP connections can carry a bewildering array of data types,
but if you have to choose just one, Python dictionaries are
an excellent choice. They are good vehicles for carrying
collections of input and output arguments.</p>
<p>The challenge with using dictionaries is getting them
transformed into a format that can be transferred
over the connection. There are several steps to the process</p>
<pre><code>dict -> json -> string -> bytes
</code></pre>
<p>In code, this can be done in a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>body = json.dumps(body_dict).encode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>Dictionary to JSON and JSON to string conversion is trivial,
thanks to the <code>json</code> library. <code>json.dumps()</code>
is short for "take this Python dictionary, parse it and
convert it to JSON, then dump that JSON out to
a stringified version."</p>
<p>Gotchas:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not the same as <code>str(body_dict)</code>.
If you try this, you will get confusing errors.
(Ask me how I know.)</li>
<li>Numpy arrays don't mix well with JSON.
They also give confusing errors.
If you want to include arrays in your dict,
first convert them to lists with <code><np.array>.tolist()</code>.
You can convert them back on the other end with
<code>np.array(<list&g>)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>String to bytes conversion can be done with the
<code>.encode('utf-8')</code> appended on the end of the line.
There are several ways to encode string data as bytes but
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><code>utf-8</code></a>
has become far and away the most common, particularly in HTTP use cases.
Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise,
you're safe to use this throughout your clients and servers.</p>

<h2>Request headers</h2>
<p>In Python, we're used to playing fast and loose with data types
and memory allocation, but in HTTP we can't get away with that any more.
You can't even assume that you know what language the server
on the other side of the connection is written in,
let alone what types or message size it is expecting.
As with all relationships, the answer to this challenge
is good communication. HTTP gives clients a way to signal ahead
what type of data they will be sending and how much of it.
That way there are no misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Headers are the pre-message that give this meta-information.
They are a short instruction manual, a packing manifest.
In the example code above it includes two fields,
one declaring the type of data and one declaring
the number of bytes being transferred.</p>
<pre><code>headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': len(body),
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Content-Type</code> and <code>Content-Length</code> are
a nice miminal set of headers, but there are lots others.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">
The full list of headers</a> shows just how varied the set
of instructions and information passed to the server can be.
Header field names are not case sensitive, so you may run
across a variety of capitalization conventions here.</p>

<h2>Content type</h2>
<p>JSON is a good multi-purpose message format, but except
for the times when you are writing your own server,
you'll have to provide a content type that the server expects.</p>

<p>Another extremely common content type is <code>text/html</code>,
used for sharing web pages, arguably the main use case
for which the <em>hypertext transfer</em> protocol was developed.</p>

<p>In addition to these there are a lot of other types.
So many. Literally
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">
hundreds of them</a>. Looking at just some of the text formats,
there are specific types for</p>

<ul>
<li><code>text/css</code></li>
<li><code>text/csv</code></li>
<li><code>text/javascript</code></li>
<li><code>text/plain</code></li>
<li><code>text/xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>and besides these there are many others for varieties of
image, audio, video, email message, and application content.</p>

<p>Luckily you don't have to guess. If you're writing a client
for a server, you can look at the API specification for it
to find out what content type it's expecting.</p>

<h2>The action (The VERB)</h2>
<p>Requests are also sent with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods">an action</a>
attached, such as <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>,
clearly inspired by common operations in serving web pages.</p>

<p>GET can be interpreted very broadly as any operation where
the client is hoping to get something back, like a web page,
the output of a computation, the result of a database query,
or the output of a model. But GET requests are not just
one-way flows of information. They can be accompanied by
hefty payloads like input arguments, feature values, and database queries.</p>

<p>Similarly POST operations are typically upload-heavy,
but they can have generouts response payloads too.</p>

<p>Any public API worth its salt will have detailed documentation
of which actions it accepts, what the payloads look like,
and if you're really lucky, a few examples.</p>

<h2>The path</h2>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is the path.
The path argument gets top billing, its own reserved seat
on the front row, rather than being tucked away in
an argument in the body. This illustrates the original purpose of HTTP.
With web serving, most requests are for an html file,
and the path argument specifies which file that should be.</p>

<p>Whenever a request is intented to retrieve, upload, modify,
or otherwise touch a particular file, the path argument is the path
to that file, relative to the directory from which the server is running.
If I wanted to send a request to the webserver for
<code>brandonrohrer.com</code> to retrieve the <code>blog.html</code> file
which sits at the top level of the webserver's directory,
then the path argument would be <code>/blog.html</code>.</p>

<p>If the server doesn't need path information, it's fine to leave
the path argument as a benign <code>/</code>,
as in the code example above.</p>

<p>Again, a public API will usually document what the path
should be for any given content, resource, or action.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Now that the header, the body, the action, and the path are sorted,
they can be sent to the server using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPConnection.request">
<code>request()</code></a> function, which kicks off
the request processing</p>

<pre><code>conn.request("GET", "/", body, headers)
</code></pre>

<p>and the response can be retrived with
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPConnection.getresponse">
<code>getresponse()</code></a></p>
<pre><code>response = conn.getresponse()
</code></pre>

<p>And this completes the journey of formulating and submitting the request.
Huzzah!</p>

<h2>Interpreting the response from the server</h2>
<p>Unpacking the server response looks a lot like composing the request,
in reverse. Responses come in the form of a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#httpresponse-objects">
HTTPResponse object</a>
which saves us the trouble of fiddly parsing and has some helpful
fields and methods for pulling out the information we need:
a status report, response headers, and the response body.
These three parts all show up in the example code.</p>
<pre><code>if response.status == 200:
    content_length = int(response.getheader('Content-Length'))
    return json.loads(response.read(content_length).decode('utf-8'))
</code></pre>

<h2>Response status</h2>
<p>Every HTTP response comes with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">
a numerical code</a> telling how it went.
Status codes are 3 digits long with the first digit being 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
From the Wikipedia page:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1xx informational response</strong> – the request was received, continuing process</li>
<li><strong>2xx successful</strong> – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted</li>
<li><strong>3xx redirection</strong> – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request</li>
<li><strong>4xx client error</strong> – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled</li>
<li><strong>5xx server error</strong> – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request</li>
</ul>
<p>Or abbreviated:</p>
<ul>
<li>1xx: FYI </li>
<li>2xx: A-OK</li>
<li>3xx: We moved</li>
<li>4xx: You messed up</li>
<li>5xx: We messed up</li>
</ul>
<p>and I cannot recommend strongly enough the
<a href="https://httpstatusdogs.com">HTTP status dogs</a>
who illustrate every status code for pup-loving visual learners.</p>

<p>Code 200 is the signal that everything went well, and the client
code above checks for that before trying to process the response.
A more robust client would check for other codes, especially 5xx codes,
and have fallback strategies and informative error messages.</p>

<h2>Response headers</h2>
<p>Just like request headers, response headers carry
the information needed to handle the message. The list of common
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Response_fields">
response headers</a> is extensive. Again <code>Content-Type</code>
and <code>Content-Length</code> are particularly useful.
They tell what type of message body is expected and how large it is.</p>

<p>The <code>getheader()</code> method pulls out the value
of a given header field. There is also a <code>getheaders()</code>
method which lists all the available headers.
This one is extra useful for exploring undocumented API behavior.</p>

<h2>Reponse body</h2>
<p>Not every response has a body, but if it does, the
<code>read()</code> method is the way to pull those payload bytes
out and start working with them. <code>read(content_length)</code>
reads a fixed number of bytes and will wait, listening on the line
until the specified number of bytes have been received.
If you trust your sever to provide one, you can call <code>read()</code>
without a number of bytes and it will keep reading until it finds
an <code>EOF</code> character.</p>

<p>Almost every time, the first step is to decode the content with
<code>decode('utf-8')</code> to get a string. And then, if it happens
to be content type of <code>application/json</code> you can
finish backing out the response content by calling
<code>json.loads()</code>. This loads the string as a JSON object,
then converts that JSON to a dictionary. The content of
the dictionary (or whatever form the response happens to be)
depends entirely on the server.</p>

<h2>A quick note on levels of abstraction</h2>

There are several different tools for interacting with HTTP servers
in Python. They are at different levels of abstraction, that is,
they make different assumptions about what the person writing the code
is supposed to know; they're at different levels of down-in-the-weeds.
Typically the higher the level of abstraction, the more assumptions
are made behind the scenes and the fewer lines of code necessary to
get the job done.

Very roughly from highest to lowest level:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/">urllib3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html">requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html">http.client</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html">socket</a></li>
</ul>

I've chosen to run with <code>http.client</code> here because I'm interested in
having (and giving) a lot of control and covering a lot of potential
networking use cases. Also, <code>http.client</code> has a lot of symmetry with
<code>http.server</code>, which will feature in a companion post.

<p>
This concludes the tour of a bare-bones HTTP Python client.
This has only scratched the surface of a huge topic, but hopefully
it will get you unstuck as you are coding up your first few
clients in Python.

Stay tuned for the sequel, the tour of a bare-bones HTTP Python server.
