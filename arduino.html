<h2><a id="Why-Arduino?"></a><a href="#Why-Arduino?">Why Arduino?</a></h2>

<p>
Arduino gives builders a gift&mdash;a way to bridge the gap between
code and the physical world. At the heart of every Arduino board is a
programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontroller</a>
chip with names like
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf">ATMega2560</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M">ARM-Cortex-M</a>.
If you imagine a laptop, take away the screen and the keyboard, and
shrink everything else down to a miniature scale, you won't be too far away
from a microcontroller. 
</p>

<p>
Microcontrollers com in a single integrated circuit, like this.

Arduino helps out hobbyists by putting them on a larger board like this.

<p>
The Arduino board gives easy access to the tiny pins of the IC and makes it
possible to plug in standard connectors for power and USB communications.
</p>

<p>
What makes the microcontroller so powerful isn't its computational capabilities
(they are pretty pathetic compared to the processor in your phone). What makes
it special is the large collection of input/output pins.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Digital I/O</strong> pins which can pass high (3.3 or 5 Volts
depending on the board) and low (0 Volt) signals
to another circuit, as well as read high and low signals from them.</li>
<li> <strong>Analog input</strong> pins, which use an analog-to-digital converter to read
the voltage from an outside source to a fine resolution.</li>
<li> <strong>Analog output</strong> (DAC) pins, which use a digital-to-analog converter to sustain
a pin at any voltage from a near-continuous range.</li>
<li> <strong>PWM</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)">Pulse-width modulated</a>
pins, which approximate an analog voltage by rapidly switching
back and forth between high and low voltages. For example, to maintain an
average voltage of 2.2 Volts, a PWM signal will switch between 0 and 3.3 Volts,
spending two-thirds of its time at 3.3 V and one-third of its time at 0 V.</li>
<li> Specialized communication protocol pins, like UART, CAN, I2C, and SPI.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Shields-and-Carriers"></a><a href="#Shields-and-Carriers">Shields and Carriers</a></h3>

<p>
A microcontroller on its own is cool in concept, but isn't particularly useful.
Arduino makes it easy to extend them by adding on other components.
These extension boards can be stacked below (<strong>carriers</strong>) or above
(<strong>shields</strong>) the Arduino boards on rows of carefully laid out pins.
